            Perhaps the primary goal of condensed matter physics is to classify phases of matter. 
	    Historically, the best tool in that pursuit has been symmetry (see Landau's theory of
	    second order phase transitions), but more recently topology has emerged as a critical tool
	    for understanding quantum matter. In particular, topology has proven to be highly fruitful
	    in studying crystalline systems where the theory largely goes by the name <em>topological band theory</em>. 
	    A proper introduction to the subject requires quite a bit of background and can come from a variety of perspectives,
	    but the gist is that a topological phase is one which exhibits some form of topological obstruction 
	    (twist, hole, etc.) that separates it from the vacuum. This twist or hole is not in real space but
	    instead is in the state space (i.e. it is a property of the groundstate) making it fairly abstract to fresh eyes.
        <p style="font-size:15px;">
	    A central feature of topological phases is that they tend to have unusual surface properties. Intuitively, 
	    since there is a "twist" in the bulk of a topological solid and there is no twist in the vacuum/air outside,
	    there must be some sort of "untwisting" at the surface. The result is bizarre surface behavior that is highly robust
	    and is said to be <em>topologically protected</em> (at least perturbatively). This was the focus of my research &mdash;
	    topological surface states.
        <p style="font-size:15px;">
	    Topological band theory is rich and beautiful so I would be regretful if I did not at least provide a peak into the
	    theory for the mathematically inclined. Consider this a starting point for someone who wants to 
	    read more about the details:
        <p style="font-size:15px;margin-left:45px">
	    One approach known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01935"><em>topological quantum chemistry</em></a> uses 
	    graph theory and an unorthodox representation theory of space groups to infer if a band structure has a corresponding real 
	    space description. Here, a topological system is one which does not have such a real space description and 
	    is said to have an <em>obstructed atomic limit</em>. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:15px;margin-left:45px">
	    Another more general approach uses <em>topological K-theory</em> (<a href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/media/Krulewski-K-Theoretic-thesis.pdf">pdf</a>), a scheme for classifying
	    vector bundles by their topological properties. Here, we utilize the fact that the ground state
	    configuration of a crystalline system forms a vector bundle over a compact momentum space which is 
	    isomorphic to a <em>d</em>-torus in <em>d</em> dimensions.

            As part of my graduate work studying topological surface phonons, I developed a 
            Julia package called <span class="code">LatticeDynamics.jl</span>. It consists of tools for 
            studying crystal phonons by building interatomic force models and computing their bulk and 
            surface phonon structure. Surfaces can be studied in both slab and semi-infinite geometries.
